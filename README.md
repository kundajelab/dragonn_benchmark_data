# dl_tricks_on_standardize_datasets
Deep learning methods and unit tests for standardized datasets. Used as a benchmark for new approaches. 

1 .datasets from the GECCO variant scoring project, varying levels of difficulty
  a. GC-balanced 1 positive: 1 negative
  b. GC-balanced 1 positive: 5 negatives
  c. Dinucleotide-balanced 1 positive: 1 negative
  d. Dinucleotide-balanced 1 positive: 5 negatives
  e. ENCODE universal negatives
  f. Differential peaks within the GECCO task set (i.e. sample V576 vs union of peaks from other samples).
